This project contains the replication of figures IV and VI from Memory and Probability (Bordalo et al., 2022)

All code used to generate the figures can be found in the Code/, and images of our generated figures can be
found in the Figures/ 

We have included both a Jupyter Notebook version of the python code which 
will show the output in browser on GitHub with no downloads, simply navigate to the 
'Preview' tab of ReplicationCode.ipynb to see the code and figures.
You can also run this file locally as long as you have Anaconda3 installed.

Alternatively if you'd rather you may run the files that end in '.py' in the command line or 
IDE of your choice. The only required software is Python 3.9 or later with pandas and matplotlib 
installed.

The authors original work can be found in MAP_QJE_ReplicationMaterials/.
